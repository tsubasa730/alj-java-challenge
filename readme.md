### What I have done
- Added unit tests
- Protected controller end points
- Improved doc and comments
- Bug fixed for some services
- Added exception handler

### What I would have done if had more time
- Add caching logic for database calls (Honestly, I am not familiar in this area and do not have time to study this part.)
- Add validation of input for endpoints

#### My experience in Java

- I have 4 years experience in Java.
- Although I have used Spring Boot in one of my job before, it was in very initial stage.
- So I will say I just recently learned Spring Boot.
